# Introduction
This is a task given to me by the brilliant Eng. Fady Khalil during my ITI Embedded Systems 9-Months Scholarship.

# Walkthrough
The purpose of this project is to try building an embedded application (Test_App) that accesses the required drivers from an entirely different directory in an attempt to make driver development more flexible/dynamic/reusable between projects. Additionally, both the driver library and the project itself should be built using CMake *paniiiik!*.

# Results
It was a complete success! :DD
